# JWT Issuer in Rust

The [jwt-issuer-rs](https://github.com/vishpat/jwt-issuer-rs) project implements a simple JWT Issuer in Rust. The project provides an example of how the  JWT Issuer can be used as a [JWT authenticator](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/jwt) for Hashicorp [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io).

For details refer to the online [book](https://vishpat.github.io/jwt-issuer-rs)
